! These example programs are translation to Fortran of the
! C++ example programs in the SINTEF SISL distribution. They
! demonstrate most of the steps required to use the various
! SISL C functions.

There are two ways to compile the examples:

1. After building the Fortran interfaces type:
     make SISL_LIBPATH=/path/to/SISL/libary examples
   to build all of the examples at once 
   NOTE: this assumes you have built an archive version of the SISL
         C library named sisl.a

2. Use one of the makex scripts to build individual versions of the examples.
   On Linux and Mac systems type
  
     export SISL_LIBPATH=/path/to/SISL/library (assuming bash shell)
     makex_intel example13
  
   to build example13 using the Intel compiler

All executables have a .x file extension to make cleaning etc. easier 

Since most of the examples use files generated by previous examples a runall script is provided that executes each example in sequence (1-15)
