# 1.0 How to build forSISL

  Currently forSISL has only compiled and run on Linux systems but porting to Macs and
Windows should be straightforward due to the relatively small number of files
that make up the code base. A simple build system that uses standard Unix/Linux make
file is provided along with a configure bash script that sets environment variables
and make macros used in the build process. The configure script has a limited number
of command line options for setting the desired compiler, enableing warning
messages during compilation, and changing the optimization level from the default
value of O2. The Intel oneAPI compilers and GNU GCC gfortran versions 8, 9, and 10
are supported. If a compiler is not specified the configure script will use 
the current version of gfortran in the users default path. Users do not need
to build a version of the SINTEF SISL C library to compile forSISL but does need
the C libraries to build applications and the example programs. The steps required
to build forSISL are.

1. cd to the forSISL directory and run the configure bash script. Note you will have
to prepend a source or . before the configure command.

2. Run configure selecting the desired compiler and optimization level if desired

Example 1. Compiling with the Intel compiler (assumes ifort is in your default path)

source ./configure --compiler=intel
or
source ./configure --compiler=intel --opt-level=0
or
source ./configure --compiler=intel --warn=all --opt-level=3

make cleanall
make

Example 2. Compiling with GCC version 10 if it was installed on your system as 
           /usr/bin/gfortran-10 and /usr/bin/gcc-10. The following holds for
           versions 8 and 9 as well.

source ./configure --compiler=gcc10 -opt-level=0
or
source ./configure --compiler=gcc9
or
source ./configure --compiler=gcc8
or
source .configure  (selects the default version of gfortran and gcc)

make cleanall
make
 
A successful compilation will copy the .mod files generated to the forSISL/modules
directory and the resulting libraries (forSISL.a and forSISL.so) to the forSISL/lib
directory. Future versions will support a make install to copy the modules and
library files to a user define alternative location.

3 To compile all of the example programs at one time make sure you have built a
  version of the SISL C libraries (and named the libraries sisl.a and sisl.so)
  Then:

  make SISL_LIBPATH=/your/pathto/SISL/lib examples

  Alternatively you can build individual versions using the makex scripts found in
  the examples directory. To use the makex scripts do:

  export SISL_PATH=/your/pathto/SISL/lib
  makex_intel example04 etc.

  Note the examples depend on output from previous example problems so you should
  run them in order of 1-15.

4. make clean will clean just the .o and .mod files in /src
   make cleanall removes all the .o and .mod files from ./src, the .a and .so file
   from ./lib, the .mod files from .modules, and the executable files (.x) and output
   files (.g2) in the example directory.

# 2.0 Support for MAC and Windows
   
   Since I don't have access to a Mac and hell will freeze over before I use a Windows system,
   I'll leave it to users to figure out how to build forSISL on those systems. Since forSISL
   consists of a relatively few number of files, it should be straightforward to just copy the
   source files to some directory and use Xcode or Visual Studio to set up a forSISL project.
   The Makefile in forSISL/src should show you the order in which the modules must be built.

# 3.0 If you have problems (its probably your fault (:>))

However, send me an email and I'll try to help
